  <h2>Cs</h2>
  <h3>Atomic number 55</h3>
  <p>Caesium is a chemical element with symbol Cs and atomic number 55. It is a soft, silvery-gold alkali metal with a melting point of 28.5 degrees C which makes it one of only five elemental metals that are liquid at or near room temperature. Caesium metal is highly reactive and very pyrophoric. In addition to igniting spontaneously in air, it reacts explosively with water even at low temperatures, more so than other members of the first group of the periodic table.</p>
